# 3D Quiz Project Report

## Live Deployment

**Live Demo:** https://dyadyabober.github.io/3D_Quiz

## Project Overview

This is an interactive 3D programming quiz application built with Three.js, featuring:

- **3D Environment:** Immersive space-themed background with animated stars, particles, and binary digits
- **Progressive Quiz System:** Three difficulty levels (Basic, Advanced, Expert) with programming questions
- **Interactive Navigation:** Scroll-based movement through 3D space with mouse look controls
- **Visual Feedback:** Dynamic board animations, color-coded answers, and particle effects
- **Ukrainian Language:** Full localization in Ukrainian for educational accessibility
